# Kata 8

## Beginner Series #2 Clock

    Clock shows h hours, m minutes and s seconds after midnight.  

    Your task is to write a function which returns the time since midnight in milliseconds.  
    Example:  

        h = 0
        m = 1
        s = 1

    result = 61000  

    Input constraints:  

        0 <= h <= 23
        0 <= m <= 59
        0 <= s <= 59

## Learning TypeScript. Basic Types

    Learning TypeScript. Basic Types
    Overview

        In this kata you'll get familiar with TypeScript's basic types.
        If you have problems solving this kata please refer to this [article](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html)

    Task
    Boolean

        Export var1Boolean variable of boolean type with value true.  

    Number

        Export var2Decimal variable of numeric type with decimal value 13.  
        Export var3Hex variable of numeric type with hex value f00d.  
        Export var4Binary variable of numeric type with binary value 111111.  
        Export var5Octal variable of numeric type with octal value 744.  

    String

        Export var6String variable of string type with value Hello, world!.  

    Array

        Export var7Array variable of array type with value [1, 'test', {a: 3}, 4, 5].  
        Export var8NumericArray variable of numeric generic array type with value [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].  

    Tuple

        Tuple types allow you to express an array where the type of a fixed number of elements is known, but need not be the same.  

        Export var9Tuple variable of tuple type with value ['key', 12345] - i.e. it should represent a value as a pair of a string and a number.  

    Enums

        Export var10Enum variable with value Color.Blue from enum export enum Color {Red = 1, Green = 2, Blue = 4}.  

    Any

        We may need to describe the type of variables that we do not know when we are writing an application. These values may come from dynamic content, e.g. from the user or a 3rd party library. In these cases, we want to opt-out of type-checking and let the values pass through compile-time checks. To do so, we label these with the any type.  

        Export var11ArrayOfAny variable of Array<any> type with value [1, 'test', {a: 3}, 4, 5].  

    Void

        Export var12VoidFunction function that returns void.

    Null and Undefined

        Export var13Null variable with type and value null.  
        Export var14Undefined variable with type and value undefined.  

    Never

        Export var15NeverFunction function that returns never value.

## FIXME: Replace all dots

    The code provided is supposed replace all the dots . in the specified String str with dashes  
    - But it's not working properly.  
    
    Task:  
      Fix the bug so we can all go home early.
